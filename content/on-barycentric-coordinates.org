When passing some attributes like or texture coordinates from vertex shaders to fragment shaders GPUs magically interpolate these values. It's interesting how one might implement such a feature. In this article we'll look at barycentric coordinate system; which is one of the ways to compute attributes for pixels inside a triangle.

* Barycentric

Let's solve a simple task that I faced when I was writing my small software rasterizer. Given the depth values for a triangle's vertices how do we compute depth values for pixels in that triangle?

There's very elegant solution to this problem: using a different ~coordinate system~. From wikipedia: "The barycentric coordinates of a point can be interpreted as masses placed at the vertices of the simplex(in our case triangle), such that the point is the center of mass (or barycenter) of these masses".

Given depth values of triangle's corners $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$ and barycentric coordinates of a point $z_1$, $z_2$, $z_3$ we can calculate depth value for that point.

\[
d = d_1 z_1 + d_2 z_2 + d_3 z_3
\]

It is also very simple to convert our point $(x, y)$ to barycentric coordinates. Let's say
\[
A = \begin{vmatrix}
     x_1 & y_1 & 1\\
     x_2 & y_2 & 1\\
     x_3 & y_3 & 1
     \end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
A_1 = \begin{vmatrix}
     x & y & 1\\
     x_2 & y_2 & 1\\
     x_3 & y_3 & 1
     \end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
A_2 = \begin{vmatrix}
     x_1 & y_1 & 1\\
     x & y & 1\\
     x_3 & y_3 & 1
     \end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
A_3 = \begin{vmatrix}
     x_1 & y_1 & 1\\
     x_2 & y_2 & 1\\
     x & y & 1
     \end{vmatrix}
\]
Having those determinants we can calculate the barycentric coordinates: $z_1 = \frac{A_1}{A}$, $z_2 = \frac{A_2}{A}$, $z_3 = \frac{A_3}{A}$.

* Conclusion

This was a small article about a simple yet very useful mathematical object: barycentric coordinate system. I wasn't familiar with until yesterday which is kind of embarassing. Certainly there are much more applications for barycentric coordinates. Hopefully I'll write about them in future ðŸ™‚
